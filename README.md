FallGuard detects when an individual falls in real time using a live camera feed. This will trigger an alert system, consisting of an alarm sound and an SMS message sent to the individual’s emergency contact.

**How we built it**
Our project’s main objective is fall detection, we used computer vision and pose estimation to monitor and identify potential falls using a webcam (as a demo example for CCTV it would use in the real application setting). The code leverages MediaPipe to extract and analyze pose coordinates (key points) from video frames, visualizing these key points and drawing a bounding box around the detected body. The fall detection algorithm calculates the dimensions of this bounding box and, if the width significantly exceeds the height AND certain pose keypoints exceed a predefined threshold, it identifies a possible fall. Upon detection, the code highlights the area with a red colored and rounded rectangle, plays an alert sound, and sends a notification via Twilio's API. The video feed with these visual cues is displayed in real-time using OpenCV, with the program stopping upon receiving a quit signal (q), which is sent when the patient is safe.
